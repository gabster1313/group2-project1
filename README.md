# House of the Dragon Website

## Description

A fun page website for the TV show "House of the Dragon" containing a Characters, Episodes, and Gallery pages.

## Features

- Responsive design for tablet and mobile screens.
- CSS Flexbox for layout.
- Semantic HTML tags.
- BEM naming conventions for CSS.
- CSS transitions and animations.

## Challenges

- Ensuring the layout remains consistent across different screen sizes.
- Implementing smooth transitions and animations.
- Maintaining semantic HTML and BEM conventions.
- For some group members VS Code and Github stopped working properly and had to eventually push changes from webbrowser

## Commit Discrepancies 
I did not realize that to merge changes you only needed the repo owner to review and accept changes and not just push and that the other group members had access to merging their branches once the changes were approved, so I had extra commits due to that. I also made some edits that I noticed where I had the group members either review on github or on our chats so I could merge. Everyone else should have around the same amount of commits as each other. 

## Deployment

The website is deployed at: https://gabster1313.github.io/group2-project1/index.html
