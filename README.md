# House of the Dragon Website

## Description

A fun page website for the TV show "House of the Dragon" containing a Characters, Episodes, and Gallery pages.

## Features

- Responsive design for tablet and mobile screens.
- CSS Flexbox for layout.
- Semantic HTML tags.
- BEM naming conventions for CSS.
- CSS transitions and animations.

## Challenges

- Ensuring the layout remains consistent across different screen sizes.
- Implementing smooth transitions and animations.
- Maintaining semantic HTML and BEM conventions.
- VS Code and Github stopped working properly for some group members and they ended up pushing changes from the web browser rather than a local repo. The issues may have been due to antivirus software.

## Commit Discrepancies 
I did not realize that to merge changes you only need the repo owner to review and accept changes and not just push. I also didn't realize that the other group members could merge their branches once the changes were approved, so I created extra commits. I also made some edits that I noticed where I had the group members either review on github or on our chats so I could merge. 
Everyone else should have around the same amount of commits as each other, though. 

## Deployment

The website is deployed at: https://gabster1313.github.io/group2-project1/index.html

## Lighthouse Report

All the pages have a 91 in SEO due to our "more" tab except for some reason the "more" page the SEO in the report did not flag it's own tab.
